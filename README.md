# Array Lab

## Instructions:
### Think of a meal you love! 

1- Write an array of strings for the list of ingredients and items used to cook and put it inside a variable. 

***We want to keep our list of ingredients unchanged so please keep that in mind while you follow through*** 

2- Add some spices to the **end** of array.

3- Add another spice to the **beginning** of array.

4- Ok, that's too much spices! Remove both the **first** and the **last** elements of the array. 

5- Remove the last two items of the array and add 2 more ingredients in their place. Bonus points if you can do this with only 1 method!

6- Define a variable called mainIngredient from the array and select your main ingredient using its index.

7- Write a function that takes an array, checks all the elements in the array and logs everything other than the mainIngredient.


### Test cases:
if the main array includes the following items to create pizza: dough, tomato, cheese, pan, oven, mushroom.

Let's say our main ingredient is tomato then the result should be:
dough
cheese
pan
oven
